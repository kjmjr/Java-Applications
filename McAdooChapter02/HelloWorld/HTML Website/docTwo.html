     <h1> Basketball </h1>

<hr>
	 <h1> Favorite Sport </h1>
     <p> One of my favorite sports is Basketball.
	   If I had the opportunity, I could play 
       Basketball everyday, perhaps have an interest
	   to become a professional. </p>
	   
	
     <h2> History </h2>
	 <p> Around 6th grade, maybe the age of 11 was when I started
	    to like the game of Basketball. I even played on a few teams
		the levels such as middle school, rec, and travel league. It has all been fun
		but as they say got to make it somewhere else in life with other careers. </p>
	  

	 <h3> All ages </h3>
     <p> I also love to watch Basketball from all 
       different ages groups. Basketball is fun to play and watch
       because of the many things that go on in a game. It could be 
       a nice play, good shot, dunk, perfect pass, or excellent defense. </p>
	

	 <h4> Boys/womens </h4>
     <p> I could watch Mens Basketball or Womens Basketball 
       all day if I wanted to. I find it as a source of
	   main entertainment on tv. Basketball games and a few
	   other tv shows is about the only thing I watch on tv. </p>
  

     <h5> Pro  </h5>
     <p> In the Mens National Basketball Association league, my 
       favorite team is the Miami Heat. It has been my favorite team
       since I was a little kid and the team still is up to this day. </p>


	 <h6> College </h6> 
     <p> In the Mens College world of Basketball, my favorite team
         to watch would have to be the Carolina Tar Heels. Ever since
		 my second cousin James Michael McAdoo has played for that team
		 I have been a fan ever since. I have even been to game (Not when he played).</p>
